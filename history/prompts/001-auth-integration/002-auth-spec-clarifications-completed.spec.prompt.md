  Phase II: Full-Stack Web App Authentication Target audience: Frontend developers and Qwen Code agents implementing user authentication flows in the Todo App Focus: Secure signup, login, logout, and JWT-based user session handling between Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend Success criteria: - Users can sign up with email and password - Users can log in and receive JWT tokens from Better Auth - Frontend stores and attaches JWT tokens to all API requests - Backend verifies JWT tokens, extracts user info, and enforces user-level access - Unauthorized requests return 401 - Token expiry handled correctly (e.g., 7 days) - Spec is detailed enough for Qwen Code to generate frontend pages, API client, and integration code without manual intervention Constraints: - Use Better Auth for authentication (frontend) - JWT tokens must be used for backend verification - Shared secret stored in environment variable BETTER_AUTH_SECRET - Spec must be in Markdown, compatible with Spec-Kit Plus - Should integrate smoothly with existing /api/tasks endpoints Not building: - Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.) - Password recovery flows - Admin-level user management - UI styling beyond basic Tailwind CSS components --- # Feature: Authentication ## User Stories 1. **Signup** - As a new user, I can register with my email and password - I receive a JWT token upon successful signup 2. **Login** - As a returning user, I can log in with email/password - I receive a JWT token upon successful login 3. **Logout** - As a user, I can log out, clearing the session locally 4. **Authenticated API Access** - As a user, I can make requests to /api/tasks endpoints - The backend validates JWT tokens and returns only my tasks - Unauthorized requests return 401 ## Acceptance Criteria - **JWT Integration** - Token generated by Better Auth on frontend - Token attached to all API requests in Authorization header - Backend verifies token using shared secret - Token expiry enforced - **User Isolation** - Users can only access/modify their own tasks - **Error Handling** - Invalid or missing tokens result in 401 Unauthorized - **Frontend Flow** - Signup → store token → redirect to /tasks - Login → store token → redirect to /tasks - Logout → clear token → redirect to /login --- # Subagents and Skills to Use ## Spec Architect Agent - **Skills:** spec-writer, spec-validator - **Use:** Ensure spec is complete, accurate, and follows Spec-Kit conventions ## Frontend Engineer Agent - **Skills:** nextjs-ui-builder, api-client - **Use:** Implement login, signup pages, store JWT token, attach token to API requests ## Backend Engineer Agent - **Skills:** fastapi-crud, jwt-verifier - **Use:** Verify JWT tokens in API requests, enforce user-level access, return proper error codes ## Auth & Integration Agent - **Skills:** better-auth-config, auth-integration - **Use:** Configure Better Auth to issue JWT, integrate frontend login/signup flows with backend token verification --- # Implementation Notes - Frontend pages: /login, /signup, /tasks - Components: LoginForm, SignupForm, Navbar (shows login/logout state) - API calls: Use centralized /lib/api.ts client - Shared secret: BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (same for frontend + backend) - Testing: Ensure 401 returned for expired/invalid tokens, users cannot see others' tasks

  Successfully completed the clarification session for the authentication integration feature specification. Five critical questions were asked and answered:

  1. JWT Storage: Confirmed HttpOnly cookies for security
  2. Password Hashing: Specified bcrypt as the hashing method
  3. Token Expiration: Confirmed 7-day duration
  4. Email Verification: Determined it should be optional
  5. Rate Limiting: Specified per-IP limiting for auth endpoints

  All clarifications have been integrated into the specification:
  - Updated functional requirements (FR-005, FR-004a, FR-011, FR-016)
  - Modified Key Entities to include email verification status
  - Added rate limiting to Edge Cases
  - Created a Clarifications section with all answers

  The specification is now more precise and ready for the planning phase.
outcome: "Authentication specification clarified and updated with security-focused decisions"
evaluation: "The clarification session successfully resolved key security and implementation ambiguities, making the specification more precise and actionable for development."
